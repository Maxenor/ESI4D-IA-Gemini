## **Features**

- **Historian Persona**: The chatbot is fine-tuned to provide responses related to historical events, figures, and concepts.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can ask history-related questions and receive detailed responses in real time.
- **Simple and Customizable**: Easy to install and modify for specific use cases.

## **Prerequisites**

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Google Application Credentials (Service Account)**
- **Pip** package manager

---

## **Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git
cd YourRepository
```

### **2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### **3. Install Required Packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If a `requirements.txt` file is missing, install packages manually:

```bash
pip install flask google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 python-dotenv
```

### **4. Set Up Google Application Credentials**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your service account credentials:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add the following line to the `.env` file:

```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path_to_your_service_account_key.json
```

Make sure you replace `path_to_your_service_account_key.json` with the actual path to your Google service account credentials file.

## **Fine-tuning Explanation**

**Fine-tuning** is the process of taking a pre-trained model and updating it with additional training data for a specific task. In this application, we fine-tuned the **Gemini model** to behave like a historian by training it with history-related questions and answers. This allows the chatbot to generate more accurate and contextually relevant historical responses.

### **Differences between Fine-tuned and Non-tuned Models:**

- **Non-tuned**: Uses a general-purpose model that can handle a wide variety of questions but lacks specific expertise.
- **Fine-tuned**: The chatbot is trained on historical data, making it more accurate and knowledgeable about history. It is less likely to provide off-topic or general answers, focusing instead on historical contexts.

---

## **Usage**

### **1. Running the Application**

Start the Flask server by running:

```bash
python app.py
```

### **2. Accessing the Chat Interface**

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

You can now ask the chatbot questions related to history and get detailed responses.
